    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by our Facebook Messenger bot, which is a personal project for learning and showcasing purposes.</p>

    <p>The bot collects messages sent to it via Facebook Messenger. These messages are processed to provide responses and are not stored or shared with third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This bot is used to learn about interacting with Facebook APIs, AWS EC2, MySQL RDS, and other technologies. It runs 24/7 to demonstrate these technologies on my CV/resume.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Data transmitted to the bot is processed securely. However, since this is a personal learning project, no sensitive or personally identifiable information should be shared with the bot.</p>
